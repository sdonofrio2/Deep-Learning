# Deep-Learning

In this repository, I used deep learning recurrent neural networks to model bitcoin closing prices. One model uses the FNG indicators to predict the closing price while the second model  uses a window of closing prices to predict the nth closing price. I then used these models to answer the following questions:

        Which model has a lower loss?
        - The model in the "closing" file has a lower loss.

        Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
        - As the loss is lower, the "closing" model tracks the actual values better over time. 

        Which window size works best for the model?
        - 10
